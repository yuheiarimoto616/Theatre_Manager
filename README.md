# Theatre Manager
This project is a movie theater management application. It has two parts: customer and owner,
displayed on two separate pages. On the customer side, customers can see their personal
information once they enter in their ID, update their personal information, see average star
rating for movies, see which movies are shown at different theaters, and select movies based on
age ratings. <br><br>
On the manager side, the manager can add rooms to movie theaters, see all data stored in the
application, show the total dollar sales per location, see the average number of things a
customer buys at movie concession stands, find the customers who have eaten all food offered
at the concession stands, and can delete theaters. <br><br>
All in all, this project touched on customer accounts, reviews for movies, tickets for movies,
theaters and their movie rooms, the movies themselves, and concession stands.
